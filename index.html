        Point.creditcard focuses on the core unit of most reward programs – the point. Learn how points are
        created, valued and redeemed so you can judge whether “10,000 points” is a great deal or just marketing.

    </section>

    <!-- What is a point? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What is a “point” in card rewards?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        A point is the basic accounting unit many credit-card reward programs use to track the value you earn
        from spending. It is a kind of internal currency that can later be exchanged for cash, travel or other
        rewards – but the real value per point can vary dramatically.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Issuer points</strong> – points owned and controlled by the card issuer or bank.</li>
        <li><strong>Airline or hotel points</strong> – loyalty currency issued by a travel partner program.</li>
        <li><strong>Coalition &amp; multi-partner points</strong> – points that can be used across many brands.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed-value points</strong> – points always worth a set amount (e.g. 1 cent per point).</li>
        <li><strong>Variable-value points</strong> – points whose value depends on how and where you redeem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Two cards can both give you “1 point per unit of currency”, but if one point is worth twice as much at
        redemption, the real reward rate is completely different.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How points are created, tracked &amp; redeemed</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Points are not magic – they are generated and destroyed according to rules that are designed by issuers
        and partners. The life-cycle of a point typically looks like this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Earning</strong> – each eligible transaction generates points based on your card’s
          earn-structure (base + bonus categories, promotions, tiers).</li>
        <li><strong>2. Posting</strong> – earned points are posted to your account, often on or shortly after the
          statement date.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Pooling &amp; transfer</strong> – in flexible programs, you can pool points across cards,
          or transfer them to airline/hotel partners.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Redemption</strong> – points are redeemed for cash, travel, gift cards, merchandise or
          partner rewards at specific conversion rates.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Expiry &amp; breakage</strong> – unused points may expire after a period of inactivity or
          a fixed time limit, creating “breakage” that benefits the issuer.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Devaluation</strong> – programs can change the number of points required for rewards,
          silently reducing the real value per point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The headline earn-rate is only half the story. You have to follow points all the way to redemption to
        know what they are really worth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common point-system models</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Not all point systems are built the same. These are the main structures you will encounter when
        evaluating cards:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Fixed-value point systems</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Each point has a stable monetary value (for example, 1 point = 1 cent when redeemed as statement
            credit). Easy to calculate, low complexity, no “sweet spots”.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Tiered redemption systems</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Points are worth more when redeemed in certain ways (e.g. travel booked via a specific portal)
            and less for others (e.g. basic gift cards or cash).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Transferable points</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Points that can be transferred to airline or hotel programs at a fixed ratio. Potential for very
            high value when used for premium cabins or high-end hotels.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Co-branded single-ecosystem points</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Points issued directly by an airline, hotel or retailer’s loyalty scheme. Powerful if you are
            loyal to that brand, but limited outside the ecosystem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Hybrid points &amp; cashback</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Points that can be converted either to cash or to partner miles/points. Flexibility is high, but
            effective value depends on choice and timing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Dynamic-pricing points</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Redemption cost in points changes based on cash price, demand or yield management – common in
            airline/hotel programs, complicating value calculations.
          </p>

        Points can be powerful, but also confusing. These are the main places where value can quietly leak away:

            <td>Chasing points aggressively but rarely redeeming leads to hoarding and risk of loss.</td>
            <td>Keep a plan for redemption; avoid stacking points “just in case”.</td>

          <tr>

            <td>Interest on carried balances quickly dwarfs any point value gained.</td>
