          Cards advertise “points on every purchase”, but point values vary wildly. This page breaks down how points are created, what they’re really worth in cash or travel, and how to avoid low-value redemptions that dilute your efforts.

      <h2>What Are Credit-Card Points?</h2>
      <p>Credit-card points are a rewards currency issued by banks or card networks. You earn them when you spend on the card, and later redeem them for travel, statement credits, gift cards or transfers to airline and hotel programs.</p>
      <p>Unlike fixed cash-back, points do not have a single guaranteed value. The same balance can be worth very little in one redemption channel and significantly more in another, which is why understanding the program’s options matters more than the headline earn rate alone.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Points Are Created and Added to Your Account</h2>
      <p>Every time a transaction posts, the issuer classifies the merchant and applies the card’s earn rules. General purchases might earn a base rate, while categories such as travel, dining or groceries earn bonus points.</p>
      <p>Points are tracked in a rewards ledger separate from your credit balance. Some issuers credit them immediately; others batch them and add them on your statement date. Promotional earn, such as welcome bonuses or limited-time multipliers, is usually layered on top and posted once conditions are met.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Point Values, Sweet Spots and Poor Redemptions</h2>
      <p>Point programs often quote a “from X cents per point” value, but real outcomes vary. Using points for gift cards or low-end merchandise can yield a weaker rate, while transferring to travel partners and booking premium cabins can sometimes generate higher value per point.</p>
      <p>To compare cards, many people estimate an average value per point based on the redemptions they realistically use. The card with a slightly lower earn rate can still be stronger if its points consistently redeem at a higher and more reliable value.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Transfer Partners and Ecosystem Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Some point systems are “closed”, meaning you redeem only through the card issuer’s own portal or catalog. Others are “open”, letting you move points into multiple airline and hotel programs at defined transfer ratios.</p>
      <p>Having strong transfer partners adds flexibility: if one program devalues its chart, you can redirect future points to a different partner. This ability to pivot between ecosystems is a key reason many advanced users prefer flexible bank points over single-airline mileage programs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Expiry, Devaluations and Program Risk</h2>
      <p>Point balances can lose value in two ways: individual points may expire if an account is inactive, and programs may reduce the value of points over time by changing prices or rules. Both factors erode the benefit of holding large unused balances.</p>
      <p>Watching for expiry rules, tracking program announcements and redeeming periodically can reduce the impact of devaluations. Treat points as a rebate tool, not a long-term investment—earning and using them steadily often beats hoarding for a distant “someday”.</p>
